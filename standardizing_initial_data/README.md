# Fixing and balancing the author-provided data

Dealing with the author-pdovided CSV file, I had noticed it was 'untidy' in that it didn't adhere to one variable per column and row. Pandas `explode()` is able to handle that but it turns out the identifiers between the two columns,  `Uniprot_ACCs` & `genenames`, were not in-order matched as I had initially through based on cursory examination of some manageable examples.
Looking into that 'untidy' data further I noted that in addition to data multiple identifiers per row, not in consistent order between the two columns that there's also mixed data types with 'mixed delimiter' issues & some inconsistencies.
The Jupyter notebook, and associted files, here help address that and make an in-order matched and balanced CSV file.   
See the notebook itself for details and processing.  

Note, for the shareable Jupyter sessions to make it easy to work through the Jupyter notebooks in the series, I already was not able to get the data directly from the author's site because MyBinder.org-provided sessions do not seem to allow access. I think a port is blocked. And so I had already copied the current version of the author-provided data to a resource MyBinder could access. So now the concern will be keeping it consistent with what the authors provide in case they update it. I did though leave this notebook here in a way that it can easily be run if the source data is extended or improved by the authors.
