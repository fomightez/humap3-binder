    "# Highlight differences between hu.MAP 2.0 and hu.MAP 3.0 data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is primarily an intermediate to introducing to the next notebook in this series, ['Using snakemake to highlight differences between hu.MAP 2.0 and hu.MAP 3.0 data for multiple identifiers'](Using_snakemake_to_highlight_differences_between_hu.MAP2_and_hu.MAP3_data_for_multiple_indentifiers..ipynb). Here the steps to see the difference between complexes represented in hu.MAP 2.0 and hu.MAP 3.0 data is done with one example. You can change the hard-coded values here to investigate the differences for others. However, chances are you are interested in the differnces for several genes/proteins. In ['Using snakemake to highlight differences between hu.MAP 2.0 and hu.MAP 3.0 data for multiple identifiers'](Using_snakemake_to_highlight_differences_between_hu.MAP2_and_hu.MAP3_data_for_multiple_indentifiers.ipynb), it will work through the steps to run a Snakemake workflow to process the identifiers for many proteins/genes to generate summary reports highlighting differences in human complexes reported in hu.MAP 2.0 vs. hu.MAP 3.0 data. And that is more likely where you want to invest your time. You may want to quickly san the notebook below though to see the types of reports you'll expect when you give the snakemake file your list of identifiers. And with more details here it may help you troubleshoot such snakemake-generated reports. \n",
    "\n",
    "This effort just is meant to highlight possible differences. There is some approximating done to determine possible corresponding complexes that inherently brings in some possible judgement calls. You'll need to explore the results from each for yourself to compare in depth. The hu.MAP 2.0 data can be explored in sessions launched from my [humap2-binder repo](https://github.com/fomightez/humap2-binder)."
