***humap3-binder:  Jupyter notebook environment for analysis of hu.MAP 3.0-related data.***

A launchable, working Jupyter-based environment that has a collection of demonstrations of analysis of hu.MAP 3.0-related data served via MyBinder.org.

You can also easily adapt the demonstrations to analyze your favorite proteins.

Meant to be self-contained and ready-to-go. No installations or copying of notebooks is necessary if `launch binder` is clicked. Everything will just work. Of course, static versions of the notebooks can also be used. I recommend rendering the static versions by placing the URLs into the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). The views provided by [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) look best and Github's rendering often times out (your mileage may vary).
